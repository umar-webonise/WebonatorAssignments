MongoDB

As MongoDB comes under No SQL which is a very general term used to Databases like tihs.
What I mean to say is MySQL, Oracle, DB2, and so on can be categorized as one under SQL
with minimum difference in features.Where as if you see MongoDB and Cassandra are so 
vastly different from each other as Mongo is a DOCUMENT DATABASES where as Cassandra is
WIDE COLUMN STORE / COLUMN FAMILIES type.

The  structure which MongoDB uses i.e Collection , Documents & key-Value pairs are very 
flexible to define. We can store any kind of documents in the collection but that is not 
a good practice because it becomes hard for retrieving it. So basically any one with a lesser
knowledge can screw your data as there are no constraints.

Documents in MongoDB are stored in JSON Format which is also very understandable format as 
as compared to XML if u see.

In SQL we have to write Stored Procedure which is less flexible language then JavaScript
used in MongoDB to do similar purpose.

JSON documents in Mongo do not force particular data types on attribute values.
Mongo can be queried in a similar fashion as SQL (CURD Operation insert , update ,remove ,find)
so implementing an SQL kind of database can be done efficently.

One of the drawbacks of MongoDB that it can not support system with ACID transcations as 
data isn't immediately written to disk upon an insert which does give high performance on write
but might give inconsistent reads.
